					Technician.

					and
					digital signage.
					I'm going back to college to get my degree in computer science to one get a degree to not hold me

			<!-- Interests -->
			<p class="FSE-txt">
				My engineering interest are both computer programming and networking.
				Mainly I use C as my main programming language and I enjoy writing graphics engines with OpenGL.

				I have a networking homelab which consists of a 5520-24W Extreme switch, A VyOS Router and other
				hardware.
				Currently I have running an instance of Eve-NG, Netbox, Plex, Unifi Server, 2 Apache web servers, and a
				PiHole instance.

				I wish to impact the world by making clean code that functions like it is designed to.

			<h1 class="FSE-h1">Goals</h1>
			<p class="FSE-txt">
				I currently am learning C#, .NET and Blazor.
				I want to complete my clone of the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/">
					Nevada Legislative Website
				</a>.
				After this project is complete I plan on learning more linear algebra so I can make better 3D graphics
				engines without relying on libraries to do the math for me.

				The engineer I want to be is one who knows a system from the ground up and can explain the details in a
				network or code repository.
				The plan I have put out for myself is to start college which I currently am doing.
				Continue working closly with the Networking Engineers at my day job and learn from them.
				Then I will take and pass my CCNA and CCNP. All the while I continue down my programming path by being
				self taught.
